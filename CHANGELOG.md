## [v0.4.0] - 2022-11-29

### Added

- Add `Series.quotient/2` and `Series.remainder/2` to work with integer division.
- Add `Series.bintype/1` to return the underlying representation type.
- Allow series on both sides of binary operations, like: `add(series, 1)`
  and `add(1, series)`.

- Allow comparison, concat and coalesce operations on "(series, lazy series)".
- Add lazy version of `Series.sample/3` and `Series.size/1`.
- Add support for Arrow IPC Stream files.
- Add `Explorer.Query` and the macros that allow a simplified query API.
  This is a huge improvement to some of the main functions, and allow refering to
  columns as they were variables.

  Before this change we would need to write a filter like this:

  ```elixir
  Explorer.DataFrame.filter_with(df, &Explorer.Series.greater(&1["col1"], 42))
  ```

  But now it's also possible to write this operation like this:

  ```elixir
  Explorer.DataFrame.filter(df, col1 > 42)
  ```

  This operation is going to use `filter_with/2` underneath, which means that
  is going to use lazy series and compute the results at once.
  Notice that is mandatory to "require" the DataFrame module, since these operations
  are implemented as macros.

  The following new macros were added:
  - `filter/2`
  - `mutate/2`
  - `summarise/2`
  - `arrange/2`

  They substitute older versions that did not accept the new query syntax.

- Add `DataFrame.put/3` to enable adding or replacing columns in a eager manner.
  This works similar to the previous version of `mutate/2`.

- Add `Series.select/3` operation that enables selecting a value
  from two series based on a predicate.

- Add "dump" and "load" functions to IO operations. They are useful to load
  or dump dataframes from/to memory.

- Add `Series.to_iovec/2` and `Series.to_binary/1`. They return the underlying
  representation of series as binary. The first one returns a list of binaries,
  possibly with one element if the series is contiguous in memory. The second one
  returns a single binary representing the series.

- Add `Series.shift/2` that shifts the series by an offset with nil values.
- Rename `Series.fetch!/2` and `Series.take_every/2` to `Series.at/2`
  and `Series.at_every/2`.

- Add `DataFrame.discard/2` to drop columns. This is the opposite of `select/2`.

- Implement `Nx.LazyContainer` for `Explorer.DataFrame` and `Explorer.Series`
  so data can be passed into Nx.

- Add `Series.not/1` that negates values in a boolean series.
- Add the `:binary` dtype for Series. This enables the usage of arbitrary binaries.

### Changed

- Change DataFrame's `to_*` functions to return only `:ok`.
- Change series inspect to resamble the dataframe inspect with the backend name.
- Rename `Series.var/1` to `Series.variance/1`
- Rename `Series.std/1` to `Series.standard_deviation/1`
- Rename `Series.count/2` to `Series.frequencies/1` and add a new `Series.count/1`
  that returns the size of an "eager" series, or the count of members in a group
  for a lazy series.
  In case there is no groups, it calculates the size of the dataframe.
- Change the option to control direction in `Series.sort/2` and `Series.argsort/2`.
  Instead of a boolean, now we have a new option called `:direction` that accepts
  `:asc` or `:desc`.

### Fixed

- Fix the following DataFrame functions to work with groups:
  - `filter_with/2`
  - `head/2`
  - `tail/2`
  - `slice/2`
  - `slice/3`
  - `pivot_longer/3`
  - `pivot_wider/4`
  - `concat_rows/1`
  - `concat_columns/1`
- Improve the documentation of functions that behave differently with groups.
- Fix `arrange_with/2` to use "group by" stable, making results more predictable.
- Add `nil` as a possible return value of aggregations.
- Fix the behaviour of `Series.sort/2` and `Series.argsort/2` to add nils at the
  front when direction is descending, or at the back when the direction is ascending.
  This also adds an option to control this behaviour.

### Removed

- Remove support for `NDJSON` read and write for ARM 32 bits targets.
  This is due to a limitation of a dependency of Polars.

## [v0.3.1] - 2022-09-09

### Fixed

- Define `multiply` inside `*_with` operations.
- Fix column types in several operations, such as `n_distinct`.

## [v0.3.0] - 2022-09-01

### Added

- Add `DataFrame.concat_columns/1` and `DataFrame.concat_columns/2` for horizontally stacking
  dataframes.
- Add compression as an option to write parquet files.
- Add count metadata to `DataFrame` table reader.
- Add `DataFrame.filter_with/2`, `DataFrame.summarise_with/2`, `DataFrame.mutate_with/2` and
`DataFrame.arrange_with/2`. They all accept a `DataFrame` and a function, and they all work with
  a new concept called "lazy series".

  Lazy Series is an opaque representation of a series that can be
  used to perform complex operations without pulling data from the series. This is faster than
  using masks. There is no big difference from the API perspective compared to the functions that were
  accepting callbacks before (eg. `filter/2` and the new `filter_with/2`), with the exception being
  `DataFrame.summarise_with/2` that now accepts a lot more operations.

### Changed

- Bump version requirement of the `table` dependency to `~> 0.1.2`, and raise for non-tabular values.
- Normalize how columns are handled. This changes some functions to accept one column or
a list of columns, ranges, indexes and callbacks selecting columns.
- Rename `DataFrame.filter/2` to `DataFrame.mask/2`.
- Rename `Series.filter/2` to `Series.mask/2`.
- Rename `take/2` from both `Series` and `DataFrame` to `slice/2`. `slice/2` now they accept ranges as well.
- Raise an error if `DataFrame.pivot_wider/4` has float columns as IDs. This is because we canÂ´t
properly compare floats.
- Change `DataFrame.distinct/2` to accept columns as argument instead of receiving it as option.

### Fixed

- Ensure that we can compare boolean series in functions like `Series.equal/2`.
- Fix rename of columns after summarise.
- Fix inspect of float series containing `NaN` or `Infinity` values. They are represented as atoms.

### Deprecated

- Deprecate `DataFrame.filter/2` with a callback in favor of `DataFrame.filter_with/2`.

## [v0.2.0] - 2022-06-22

### Added

- Consistently support ranges throughout the columns API
- Support negative indexes throughout the columns API
- Integrate with the `table` package
- Add `Series.to_enum/1` for lazily traversing the series

- `to_binary` is now `dump_csv`

- Now uses `polars`'s "performant" feature
- `Explorer.default_backend/0` is now `Explorer.Backend.get/0`
- `Explorer.default_backend/1` is now `Explorer.Backend.put/1`
- `Series.cum_*` functions are now `Series.cumulative_*` to mirror `Nx`
- `Series.rolling_*` functions are now `Series.window_*` to mirror `Nx`
- `reverse?` is now an option instead of an argument in `Series.cumulative_*` functions
- `DataFrame.from_columns/2` and `DataFrame.from_rows/2` is now `DataFrame.new/2`
- Rename "col" to "column" throughout the API
- Remove "with\_" prefix in options throughout the API
- `DataFrame.table/2` accepts options with `:limit` instead of single integer
- `rename/2` no longer accepts a function, use `rename_with/2` instead
- `rename_with/3` now expects the function as the last argument
